# Line Following Robot with path tracking, manual control, and routine capabilities

A robot that can follow a path directed by a contrasting line on the gorund. PID control has been implemented to
achieve the same. Additionally, the robot allows the user to register their routine through the koeyboard, and then
make the robot repeat it N number of times. While it is moving, the path traced by the robot so far is shown on the
VGA display in real-time using an IMU-like technique.

All processing and control is done using the ARM Cortex-A9 processor in the DE1-SoC FPGA.
